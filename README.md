# [The Weak Four](https://dph0718.github.io/The-Weak-Four/)

Choose a character.<br>
Choose your opponent.<br>
Hit the attack button. Again and again until you win or lose.<br>
If you win, you get to choose your next opponent. <br>
If you lose, you are told as much and the game is over.<br>

## Getting started:
- It's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. 
- You'll just fork the repo.
